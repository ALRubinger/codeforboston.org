#The Prototyping & Dev Lab

Labs projects are smaller, team-driven projects that may begin as an idea or a quick build. These projects follow our current model of development and rely more heavily on a specified team lead to update and involve new contributors. Labs projects will be eligible to graduate to formal Brigade-sponsored status over time. Projects will be documented on github but in order for these projects to be presented at Hack Nights, a team lead or willing team member needs to be present. If Labs projects remain dormant for more than four consecutive weeks, they will be considered “inactive.”
